# csgo-float
API server to get CSGO items' details, such as float value, skin phase, etc.
It uses the CSGO Game Communicator, so you will need a Steam account with CSGO on it.

## Input

#### Params
URL: The URL generated by steam to inspect an item in-game. (You can get that from Steam Community API)  
Example: steam://rungame/730/76561202255233023/+csgo_econ_action_preview%20S76561198264168745A7854562798D16196779082076798575

## Output

```json
{
    "iteminfo": {
        "accountid": null,
        "itemid": "7854562798",
        "defindex": 9,
        "paintindex": 344,
        "rarity": 6,
        "quality": 4,
        "paintwear": 0.08326513320207596,
        "paintseed": 222,
        "killeaterscoretype": null,
        "killeatervalue": null,
        "customname": null,
        "stickers": [],
        "inventory": 15,
        "origin": 24,
        "questid": null,
        "dropreason": null,
        "musicindex": null
    }
}
```

Note: paintwear is the float value and paintindex is what you need to identify a phase.  
Note2: customname used to hold the nametag value, but that was moved to the normal steam community API. Now it is always null.
